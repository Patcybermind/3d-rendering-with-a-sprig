# This is a 3d renderer I am making in C
This is based on spade, the ([sprigs](https://sprig.hackclub.com/)) OS.
I removed everything i didnt need and kept the display stuff, and some things i might need.
This is still a work in progress. If you want to try it out for yourself download the .uf2
file under /firmware/spade/ and flash it to your raspberry pi pico.
If you dont have a sprig but you have an st7735 display and a pico you can probably
get it to work. There is documentation explaining how to compile and other stuff in the
([original repo](https://github.com/hackclub/sprig/tree/main/firmware/spade))
feel free to propose changes comment remix this etc.
